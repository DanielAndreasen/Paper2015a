## From Maria
    + Curve of growth
    + At which S/N can we no longer determine reliable parameters?
    + Add table of line list


## From Sérgio
    + Include FeII in fig. 3
    - Justify the large errors for HD20010


## From Bárbara
    + Calculate parameters for the Sun with lines found for HD20010.
    + Include the master thesis of Henrik Rhodin: https://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/search/publication/7452647


## From Vasco
    + Calculate abundance for all lines for the Sun with 100 random draws.
      Plot the MAD for all lines vs. wavelength.
    + Try remove EWs below 10mÅ and 20mÅ for the Sun and see how telluric line
      contamination affects the derivation. Also try this for HD20010.
