\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
Effective surface temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff}$), surface gravity ($\log g$),
and metallicity ([Fe/H], where iron is used as a proxy) are fundamental
atmospheric parameters necessary to characterise a star, as well to determine
other inderict fundamental parameters, such as mass, radius, and age from
stellar evolutionary models \citep{Girardi2000}.

Precise and accurate stellar parameters are also essential in exoplanet
searches. Planetary radius, and mass are mainly found from lightcurve analysis and
radial velocity analysis, respectively. These parameters are related to the
stellar parameters.




% In this seminar I will explore the use of NIR spectroscopy towards the
% derivation of precise parameters for FGK dwarfs. This work will serve as a
% first approach to the determination of parameters in this spectral domain,
% using well known FGK dwarfs as benchmarks. NIR stellar spectra are
% significantly less blended, thus allowing for a precise line-by-line analysis
% \citep{Woolf2006,2012Onehag}. The NIR domain will then be key to solve the
% problem of M-dwarf parameter estimation. Note that the IR part of the spectrum
% is preferred over the optical for M-dwarfs because there is less photospheric
% molecular line blending and continuum depression.
%
% For the determination of stellar parameters we need to choose our approach. In
% general there is two widely used approaches to analyse spectra, 1: The
% spectral synthesis method, and 2: The equivalent method. I will use the latter
% approach.

\section{The method}
\label{sec:the_method}
Generally speaking there are two methods for determining parameters from a
spectrum.  One is the spectral synthesis method, where a synthetic spectrum is
created and by minimization procedure a best fit is found bewteen the synthetic
spectrum and the real spectrum. The stellar parameters are give from the input
to the synthetic spectrum.

The other method is the equivalent width (EW) method, which we use in this
work.  With this method the EW are measured for all lines in a line list. The
EW is given as
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:EW}
    EW = \int_0^\infty \left(1 - \frac{F_\lambda}{F_0}\right) d\lambda,
\end{align}
where $F_0$ is the continuum level and $F_\lambda$ is is the flux as a function
of wavelength. In other words, the EW width is the area from a spectral line up
to the normalized continuum level.

With the EW the abundance for individual lines can be found with a code like
MOOG\footnote{The MOOG code can be downloaded free at
\url{http://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html}}. By changing atmospheric
parameters as input for MOOG, similar abundances will be achieved for similar
elements when the right atmospheric parameters are chosen. Here we use neutral
iron and single ionized iron: FeI and FeII, respectively.

A disadvantage for this method, and a general problem with spectroscopy, is the
determination of the continuum flux level. Misplacement of the continuum leads
to wrong measurements of the EW. Many spectroscopic features make it difficult
to determine the continuum. This is especially true for cool stars in the
optical where molecular depression and line blending is an issue. By moving the
analysis to the NIR, we reduce the molecular depression, and cooler stars line
M-dwarfs emit more in this spectral region, why the continuum is at least
easier to determine.

We look at the spectral region covered by the J, H, and K bands, which cover a
spectral region larger than $\SI{15000}{\AA}$.



% The final stellar parameters are obtained when no correlation is present
% \citep{Gray2006}. The iron abundance is derived in this process, computed by
% the mean abundance given by all lines analysed.




\subsection{Compiling the line list}
All iron lines with atomic line data were downloaded from the
VALD database\footnote{The VALD database can be found here:
\url{http://vald.astro.univie.ac.at/~vald3/php/vald.php}}. In total
78537 lines of FeI and FeII are present in the spectral region (FeI:
50198 and FeII: 28339). Many of these lines are to faint to see in a
spectrum. To select the lines for the line list a spectrum of the Sun
is used downloaded from the BASS2000 web page\footnote{The web page can
be found here: \url{bass2000.obspm.fr/solar_spect.php}}. The spectrum
were downloaded in the highest possible resolution. Since the resolution
is not constant the entire spectrum were interpolated to a regular grid
with constant wavelength step of $\SI{0.01}{\AA}$.

With the spectrum on a regular wavelength grid the
EW for all the lines were measured using the ARES
software\footnote{The ARES software can be found here:
\url{http://www.astro.up.pt/~sousasag/ares/}}\citep{Sousa2007}. This
software can measure EW automatically by fitting a Gaussian profile to
a spectral line. For a given line ARES output the central wavelength of
the line, the number of lines fitted for the end result, the depth of
the line, the FWHM of the line, the EW of the line, and last Gaussians
coefficients for the line.

We remove lines from the line list based criteria listed below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If the number of fitted lines for a given line is higher than 10,
        this line is rejected because it is believed to be severely blended.
    \item If the EW is lower than $\SI{5}{m\AA}$ for a given line, the strength
        is too low and may be difficult to see in spectra with low S/N or a
        spectrum with many spectral features.
    \item If the EW is higher than $\SI{200}{m\AA}$ for a give line, the strength
        is too high and non-LTE effects is present in the core of the line.
    \item If the fitted central wavelength is more than $\SI{0.05}{\AA}$ away
        from the wavelength provided by VALD, the line will also be rejected to
        avoid false identification.
\end{itemize}




\subsection{Manually removal of lines}
\label{sub:manually_removal_of_lines}
At this step we reduced the number of lines to 6060 and 2735 for FeI and FeII
respectively. A manual inspection of the lines is necessary at this point in
order to sort bad lines.  We only removed lines where we were certain they did
not belong to either FeI or FeII from our list. The rest were kept as they
would appear as outliers later on in the analysis.

For the remaining iron lines, all lines from all elements in a small window
where downloaded. Again iron lines were removed from the list, if another
element fitted the absorption line better. Some iron lines were marked for
further investigation while the rest were kept in the line list.



\subsubsection{Synthesis of selected lines}
\label{sub:synthesis_of_selected_lines}
Lines from all elements in a small window around an iron line marked
for further investigation were used to make a synthetic spectra.
The synthetic spectra were made with MOOG. We used 3 different iron
abundances for the synthesis. One with solar iron abundance, and
then two $\pm0.2$ dex. If the synthetic spectra shows variation at
the absorption line of interest with respect to the different iron
abundances, then it's likely to be an iron line. We also changed
abundances of other elements in the proximity to see if our line is
blended with other elements.

Sometimes more than 1 iron line might be present with very similar
wavelengths. In order to find the iron line which is creating the
absorption line, one of the two were removed from the line list for
the synthetic spectra. If this removed (either fully or partially) the
absorption line in the synthetic spectra, then it will be the cause for
the real absorption line.

A few times two iron lines had similar wavelengths and excitation
potential. In those cases the $\log \mathrm{gf}$ were combined. First
converted to $\mathrm{gf}$, then an average value, and finally back to
$\log \mathrm{gf}$.


\subsubsection{Recalibrating the atomic data}
\label{ssub:Recalibrating-the-atomic-data}
The abundances were calculated for all lines with a atmosphere model
characterised by $T_\mathrm{eff}=\SI{5777}{K}$, $\log g = 4.438$,
$[Fe/H] = 0.0$, and $\xi_\mathrm{micro} = \SI{1.0}{km/s}$. If they
deviate by more than 1 dex, the lines were discarded. At this point we
are down to 319 and 12 lines, respectively for Fe I and Fe II. We only
removed Fe I lines here, since the Fe II lines are sparse and important
to determine the surface gravity.

After the removal of lines from the complete VALD line list we only need
to recalibrate the lines. Here we calculate the abundance for line to line.
If the abundance does not match the Solar abundance, the $\log \mathrm{gf}$
were changed until it does. The abundance varies more or less linearly with
$\log \mathrm{gf}$






\begin{figure}[htb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/Fe1.pdf}
    \caption{Here is shown an abundance against EW\@. All the points a re
        individual $\ce{FeI}$ lines. The green line is the Solar abundance,
7.47. The
        red lines are the mean abundance with the standard deviation. It is
        clear that we need to recalibrate the line list, so we in the end will
        measure the same abundance.}
\label{fig:Fe1}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Recalibrating the $\log gf$ values}
\label{ssub:recalibrating_the_log_gf_values}
The oscillator strength are know to be notorious difficult to measure or
calculate. Even though we have values for $\log gf$ values it is common to
recalibrate them for a star we know well \citep{2012Onehag}. For this purpose I
use the Sun. The recalibration is done line by line and follows these small
steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use MOOG to calculate the abundance for a single line with the given
        data as described in
        Section~\ref{ssub:combining_everything_in_one_file}.
    \item Calculate the difference between the abundance from MOOG with the
        known abundance for the star, in this case I use 7.47 for the Sun as
        \citet{Gonzales2000}.
    \item If the difference is not zero, then the $\log gf$ value is changed.
\end{enumerate}
This procedure is done iteratively until we reach convergence.

For finding the zero point, which this problem with recalibrating the $\log gf$
boils down to, I use the bisector method. This method repeatedly bisects an
interval and then selects a subinterval in which the root must lie for further
processing. The iteration follows this simple steps, where $a$, $b$, and $c$
are $\log gf$ values, and the function $f$ is the difference between the
abundance from MOOG and the fixed value (in the case of Sun, I use 7.47):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The interval is from $a$ to $b$ (by default I set this values to -10
        and 10).
    \item Calculate the midpoint of the interval $c=(a+b)/2$.\footnote{If $c=0$
            then a small amount (relative to the interval size) is added to
            $c$, since the abundance at $\log gf$ gives strange values.}
    \item If $a-c$ is sufficiently small, i.e.\ the interval is small, or $f(c)$
        is sufficiently small, then return $c$ and stop the iteration.
    \item Else the sign of $f(c)$ should be examined. If $f$ have different
        signs at $a$ and $c$, then the upper bound ($b$) should be replaced
        with the midpoint $c$. Else the lower bound ($a$) should be replaced
        with the midpoint.
\end{enumerate}

In Figure~\ref{fig:recalFe1} is shown a run with recalibration for a single line. We
see how the difference in abundance is converging towards zero, when changing
the $\log gf$ value.
\begin{figure}[htb!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{figures/recalFeI.pdf}
    \caption{Here is shown graphically how recalibration of the $\log gf$
        works. By changing the $\log gf$ value the difference in abundance,
        that is the abundance derived from MOOG and the reference abundance,
        is converging towards zero.}
\label{fig:recalFe1}
\end{figure}



\subsection{MOOG}
\label{sub:moog}
MOOG is best described with a few lines from the website,
\url{www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html}:
\begin{quote}
    MOOG is a code that performs a variety of LTE line analysis and spectrum
    synthesis tasks. The typical use of MOOG is to assist in the determination
    of the chemical composition of a star.
\end{quote}
MOOG can perform different task, where I use \emph{abfind}. This task
``force-fits abundances of species to yield computed equivalent widths that
agree with observed ones previously measured with other software
packages.''\footnote{From \url{http://www.as.utexas.edu/~chris/moog.html}}



\section{Summary}
\label{sec:conclusion}
It is a lengthy process to compile a final good line list for spectral
analysis, and with a high possibility to make errors along the way. E.g.\ the
data that was first used from the \url{vso.nso.edu} was not corrected in radial
velocity was used. This was only discovered by an accident after many of the
above steps were already taken. Therefore all the steps needed to be done
again, after switching to the BASS2000 dataset.

Now the solar spectrum are ready for analysis. All the neutral and first
ionized iron lines in a wide wavelength coverage in the NIR have been
downloaded from the VALD database. With the lines follows the excitation
potential and the oscillator strength. The latter has to be recalibrated for
all the lines before an analysis can take place.

Far from all the lines from the VALD database are useful for a spectral
analysis in the NIR domain. Therefore many of the lines have been removed
following the selection criteria in Section~\ref{ssec:compiling_the_line_list}.

\subsubsection{The future work}
\label{ssub:the_future_work}
At the moment of writing the next step is to remove ``false-positive'' lines,
which are lines there are found in the VALD database and seems to hit a
spectral line, but in reality the spectral line belongs to another element.
This step has to be done before recalibrating the $\log gf$ values makes sense.
Even though yet another somewhat lengthy process awaits ahead, the
recalibration software is ready, as it was already shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:recalFe1}.

The recalibration will be done with respect to the Sun, the star we know best.
The goal is to characterise M-dwarfs, but since the Sun (G2V by definition,
\citet{Gray2006}) is not far away in spectral class, it should be save to use
the Sun as a starting point. However, for benchmarking the line list a sample
of FGK-dwarfs will be analysed. These stars will have well known stellar
parameters in order to test the line list. After the benchmarking some small
corrections might be made to the line list, in order to have consistent
results.

This will be the final step before the determination of stellar parameters
using iron lines in the NIR combined with the equivalent method on M-dwarfs,
and the characterisation of this cool planet hosts.
